# Wallpaper management is handled by waypaper
# waypaper --restore is run in autostart.conf to restore your last selected wallpaper
# Use the "waypaper" command to browse and select wallpapers via GUI

# Preload and wallpaper lines are commented out since waypaper manages this
# If you want to manually set a wallpaper, uncomment and modify these lines:
# preload = ~/path/to/your/wallpaper.png
# wallpaper = , ~/path/to/your/wallpaper.png

# For multiple monitors:
# preload = ~/path/to/wallpaper1.png
# preload = ~/path/to/wallpaper2.png
# wallpaper = eDP-1, ~/path/to/wallpaper1.png
# wallpaper = HDMI-A-1, ~/path/to/wallpaper2.png

# Enable IPC (allows changing wallpaper with hyprctl)
