# Monitor Configuration

# Framework 13 Laptop Display (2256x1504 @ ~200 DPI)
# Scale 1.566667 provides logical resolution of 1440x960
# This is the recommended scale for this display (results in integer pixel dimensions)
# Note: 1.5 scale is not valid for this resolution in Hyprland 0.34+
monitor = eDP-1, 2256x1504@60, 0x0, 1.566667

# Fallback for additional monitors
monitor = , preferred, auto, 1

# Example multi-monitor setup (uncomment and adjust as needed):
# monitor = DP-1, 1920x1080@144, 1504x0, 1
# monitor = HDMI-A-1, 1920x1080@60, 1920x0, 1

# Alternative scaling options for Framework 13 (uncomment to try):
# Scale must result in integer logical resolutions for this display
# monitor = eDP-1, 2256x1504@60, 0x0, 1.333333  # 1692x1128 logical (smaller text, more workspace)
# monitor = eDP-1, 2256x1504@60, 0x0, 2.0       # 1128x752 logical (larger text, maximum readability)
# Note: Only certain scales work with 2256x1504 due to validation (1.5, 1.75 are invalid)

# Example vertical monitor:
# monitor = DP-2, 1920x1080, 0x-1080, 1, transform, 1

# Disable a specific monitor:
# monitor = HDMI-A-2, disable
